a.	primary key – A column that is unique, and cannot have a “null” value. You use a primary key like a unique identification number (ID)
b.	foreign key – a column that is used to identify a row to be connected to another database. You can use a foreign key in one database that is a primary key in another database
c.	surrogate key – an artificial primary key that has no context other than being generated
d.	entity integrity – how the database correctly created a primary key that is unique to the table
e.	referential integrity – checking to ensure that foreign keys match with primary keys
f.	weak entity – something that cannot be identified as unique without the use of a primary key or foreign key.
