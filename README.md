## More About Me:
While my [resume](eliraffo.github.io/AlphaResume_ERaffo(2019).pdf) outline my qualifications, two characteristic I wish to highlight are my passion for learning and challenge. Simply put, I will bring value to your company because I enjoy experiencing challenges and learning from them.

While working at Lane Forest Products my favorite experiences came when I learned a new business system with the help of my coworkers. When conducting the Delivery Department analysis, I had the pleasure of meeting with accountants, mechanics, department heads, stakeholders, and sales staff to understand all the separate pieces that come together to complete a customerâ€™s order. First, I learned the complex system, conducted quantitative anaylsis, and developed actionable steps. Then, I synthesisised months of analytic work into simple charts and actionable steps. Learning complex systems, simplifying those understandings, and implementing improvements is a passion of mine and something which can add value to any business.

Outside of my degree I also earned a [Certificate in Outdoor Leadership](eliraffo.github.io/OPP.PDF). Over 3 years, I attended classes on developing leadership skills and survival skills in the backcountry. I applied these lessons as an assistant leader in university classes taught by the Outdoor Pursuits Program. Leading groups of six on three-day backcountry outings, teaching outdoor rock-climbing safety, and teaching vertical rescue techniques helped me develop my skills in communicating technical ideas simply. Furthermore, attending and leading these backcountry outings taught me how to engage with challenges. Of how to wake up and engage with my teammates after falling asleep cold and wet.
