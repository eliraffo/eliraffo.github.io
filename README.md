While working at Lane Forest Products my favorite experiences came when I learned a new business system with the help of my coworkers. When conducting the Delivery Department analysis, I had the pleasure of meeting with accountants, mechanics, department heads, stakeholders, and sales staff to understand all the separate pieces that come together to complete a customerâ€™s order. First, I learned the complex system, conducted quantitative analysis, and developed actionable steps. Then, I synthesized months of analytic work into simple charts and actionable steps. Learning complex systems, simplifying those understandings, and implementing improvements is a passion of mine and something which can add value to any business.

Outside of my degree I also earned a Certificate in Outdoor Leadership. Over 3 years, I attended classes on developing leadership skills and survival skills in the backcountry. I applied these lessons as an assistant leader in university classes taught by the Outdoor Pursuits Program. Leading groups of six on three-day backcountry outings, teaching outdoor rock-climbing safety, and teaching vertical rescue techniques helped me develop my skills in communicating technical ideas simply. Furthermore, attending and leading these backcountry outings taught me how to engage with challenges. Of how to wake up and engage with my teammates after falling asleep cold and wet.

If you would like to contact me, you can find all my contact information at the top of my resume. I always enjoy conversations that relate to operations management, data analytics, and data science.
