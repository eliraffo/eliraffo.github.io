## Guide

Our [dataset](https://github.com/eliraffo/eliraffo.github.io/blob/master/OBA410/Wine_Data.csv) is comprised of data on white and red wine. Columns such as sulfur, residual sugars, etc. can be used to describe the characteristics of the wine. The 'Y' column of the data is the quality score which is on a scale from 1 to 10, and is the defined by how good the wine tastes.
